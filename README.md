# Hedgehog AI Hedge Fund

An AI-powered hedge fund analysis platform that uses charts and personas to analyze the 200 biggest companies on US markets and generate a list of potential investment long/short opportunities.

## Overview

Hedgehog uses a graph-based workflow powered by Pydantic AI with agent functions and OpenRouter to simulate a complete investment analysis process. The system employs multiple specialized agents, each focusing on different aspects of company analysis:

1. **Fundamental Analysis Agent** - Evaluates company financials and business health
2. **Technical Analysis Agent** - Analyzes price patterns and technical indicators
3. **Sentiment Analysis Agent** - Assesses market sentiment from news and social media
4. **Valuation Analysis Agent** - Calculates intrinsic value using DCF and comparable methods
5. **Warren Buffett Agent** - Applies Warren Buffett's investment principles
6. **Bill Ackman Agent** - Applies Bill Ackman's investment principles
7. **Risk Manager Agent** - Evaluates position and portfolio risk
8. **Portfolio Manager Agent** - Makes final investment decisions

The analysis workflow is orchestrated through Pydantic AI's Graph feature, which creates a directed graph of analysis steps, automatically handling the flow of data between agents.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- uv (modern Python package installer)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
"""
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hedgehog.git
cd hedgehog
"""

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
"""
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -e .
"""

3. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file with your API keys:
"""
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
FINDATA_API_KEY=your_financial_data_api_key
CHART_IMG_API_KEY=your_chart_image_api_key
LOGFIRE_TOKEN=your_logfire_token
STAGE=dev
"""

## Usage

### Analyzing Stocks

To analyze a single stock or a list of stocks:

"""
python -m hedgehog.main analyze AAPL MSFT GOOGL
"""

This will run a comprehensive analysis for each ticker and provide investment recommendations.

Optional parameters:
- `--model`: Specify a different model for analysis (default: anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet)

### Running a Backtest

To backtest the AI hedge fund strategy on historical data:

"""
python -m hedgehog.main backtest AAPL MSFT GOOGL AMZN NVDA --start 2023-01-01 --end 2023-12-31
"""

Optional parameters:
- `--capital`: Initial capital (default: $1,000,000)
- `--max-positions`: Maximum number of positions allowed (default: 10)
- `--position-size`: Maximum position size as percentage (default: 10.0%)
- `--rebalance`: Rebalance frequency in days (default: 30)
- `--no-stop-loss`: Disable stop-loss for positions

## Technical Architecture

### Pydantic AI Graph Workflow

The core of the system is built on Pydantic AI's Graph feature, which creates a directed graph workflow:

1. **Data Fetching Nodes** - Fetch company, price history, news, and peer data
2. **Analysis Nodes** - Run specialized agent functions for different analysis types
3. **Decision Nodes** - Synthesize all analyses into an investment decision
4. **Compilation Nodes** - Combine all results into a comprehensive output

Each node in the graph is a Pydantic AI-powered function that leverages large language models through OpenRouter to perform specific parts of the analysis.

### Pydantic Models

The system uses strongly-typed Pydantic models throughout to ensure data consistency and validation:

1. Analysis result models for each agent type
2. Investment decision models
3. Backtest models for simulating performance

### OpenRouter Integration

Models are accessed through OpenRouter, allowing flexibility to use different LLM providers:

1. OpenAI models (e.g., GPT-4)
2. Anthropic models (e.g., Claude 3)
3. Other providers supported by OpenRouter
